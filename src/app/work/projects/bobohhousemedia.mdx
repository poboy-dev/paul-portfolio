## Overview

Development of a flexible and robust website, with react.js for front end and supabase for database

## Key Features

- **Content management system**: Built a ontent management system to upload posts and news articles.
- **user management**: Integrated a user management system to manage roles and know who did what. 

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **supabase**: For creating and managing the database.


## Challenges and Learnings

one key challenge wa to rendered team images. the probem was that when i upload an image with a certaine name (eg: paul.jpg) supabase will change the name into a sucession of character so when i was building a url to call back the images stocked in the database i ma building using the name i have in head. so to resolve this i had to modify the way i upload images and stores them in the database.

## Outcome

the image now loads normally.
